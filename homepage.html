            <h2>Record Submission Rules</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Achieved the record without using hacks (however, FPS bypass is allowed, up to 360fps).</li>
              <li>Achieved the record on the level that is listed on the site - please check the level ID before you submit a record or submit a new level.</li>
              <li>We accept new levels but only those of Hard Demon Difficulty or above as to not spam the List with random Levels. This Rule is highly subject to change to higher requirement, for example Insane Demons and above.</li>
              <li>2 Player Demons need to have been beaten SOLO to be accepted.</li>
              <li>Do not use secret routes or bug routes, you can use skips as long as they don't skip a whole part and instead just skip for example 2-3 clicks.</li>
              <li>Do not use easy modes, only a record of the unmodified level qualifies.</li>
              <li>Please do not submit multiple records of the same record (don't submit dupes or i will smite you, or just not accept the record, have patience)!</li>
              <li>Have either source audio or clicks/taps in the video. Edited audio only does not count (Exceptions may be applicable)<li>
              <li>Once a level falls onto the Legacy List, we do not accept any more records for it, the only exception to this is if you beat it while it still was on the List but never submitted it or we missed it.</li>
              <li>If you aren't sure if something is allowed or not, you can refer back to the Pointercrate Guidelines: https://pointercrate.com/guidelines/index</li>

            <ul>

            <p>This section was something that was completely missing on the old site - a section thanking all of the people that made this project possible, of which there are many.</p>
            <p>Let's begin with the people who helped Ty and jaynt make the original list itself:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Luqualizer</li>
              <li>Zest</li>
              <li>Exyl</li>
              <li>GDonut</li>
              <li>synactive</li>
              <li>th31</li>
              <li>LuigiDB</li>
              <li>ThunderBT</li>
              <li>Kneevan</li>
              <li>Hilo</li>
              <li>Shulk-</li>
              <li>Indigo</li>
              <li>Stormfly</li>
              <li>KrmaL</li>
              <li>Hawkyre</li>
            </ul>
            <p>All of the people listed here were/are skilled LRR players at one point or another, and all of them contributed greatly to making the list as accurate as possible. (Of course, that doesn't mean there isn't room for improvement in terms of rankings, which we'll get to in a second). A big thank you to them for being significant early contributors!</p>
            <p>We would also like to thank Samiversal, for being a former longtime co-owner, FrostBurn, who did a lot of important work for the list in its Google Site days but has since left the team, and Sley, for building the LRR community server.</p>
            <p>Moving into the present: we tried to make the list as accurate as possible, but of course we messed up in places (Esencia used to be above A Bizarre Phantasm, as one example). Like we mentioned before, the list always has room for improvement and greater accuracy somewhere, so now its time to thank those who help us make the list more accurate into the present:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>ThunderBT</li>
              <li>Luqualizer</li>
              <li>Samamba</li>
              <li>Bread</li>
              <li>GDonut</li>
              <li>Exyl</li>
              <li>Hilo</li>
              <li>ItoPopcorn</li>
              <li>Coopersuper8</li>
              <li>and anyone else who's contributed an opinion, really. Thanks to you too!</li>
            </ul>
            <p>But the list isn't just ranking demons: its also a list of all of the dedicated players who have beaten said demons. Finding and adding all of those records takes a lot of work, and these people make it easier for us:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Coopersuper8</li>
              <li>Ikarya</li>
              <li>Liizoks</li>
              <li>owoZ1rc0n</li>
              <li>Samiversal</li>
              <li>SubZeroV</li>
            </ul>
            <p>And finally, a very special thank you to jack L, Vink, stadust, and NiknotNoob, who all helped me with the site itself. I especially want to thank jack L, who taught me all the javascript and json-related things that I know now which I used to build the backend for the site that you are seeing today. Oh and of course W3Schools, because that website makes learning HTML and CSS much quicker.</p>
            <h4 style = "text-align:center">Once again, this list would not have been possible without all of the people mentioned above, so we sincerely thank you guys for your support.</h4>
